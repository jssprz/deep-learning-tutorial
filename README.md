# Tutorial for Deep Learning
This tutorial provides the implementation and usage in python of several deep learning models and machine learning techniques, such as:
- Multilayer Perceptron
- Convolutional Neural Networks

## Requirements
- Tensorflow

Ypu can install all required packages with 

`pip install -r requirements.txt` 

## Datasets
In this tutorial we train and test over some widely used datasets:

- [A small version of mnist](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/se9n4tj3lh35rfm/AACTmKn7F5yVV-SaJbIWgHgna?dl=0), for fast training.
- [QuicDraw-Animals](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hsqjv0kd13xda3g/AABYkVk0ruG85s4aL4C1nDKaa?dl=0), including 12 classes of animales from the [QuickDraw](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) dataset
- CIFAR-01
